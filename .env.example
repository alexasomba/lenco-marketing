# GitHub environment variables used by the docs feedback system:
# When a developer leaves feedback on any documentation page, the site automatically
# opens a GitHub issue using these values. Use a token with the minimum scopes required
# to create issues in the target repo (for public repos: public_repo; for private repos: repo).
# Keep secrets private and rotate regularly — do not commit real tokens.
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# GitHub username or organization that owns the repository where issues from docs feedback
# will be created. Example: "alexasomba" or "my-org"
GITHUB_ISSUE_OWNER=username_of_github_owner

# Example: "lenco-marketing"

# instead of a user PAT. GitHub Apps provide finer-grained permissions and better security.
# Obtain these from your GitHub App settings and prefer this approach for automation.

# Required to request an installation access token for API calls on behalf of the app.

# The private key (PEM) for your GitHub App. Used to sign JWTs when exchanging for an installation token.
# Keep this private and store securely (do not commit). If your env system requires a single line,
# replace newlines with \n or use a secret store.
