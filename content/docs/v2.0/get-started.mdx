# Getting started

This page will help you get started with Lenco API v2.

## Securing your API token

Someone who steals your Lenco API token can interact with your accounts on your
behalf, so treat it as securely as you would treat any password. Tokens should
never be stored in source control. If you accidentally publicize a token via
version control or other methods, you should immediately reach out to
support@lenco.co to generate a new API token.

## Using the token

Authenticate your API calls by including your api token in the Authorization
header of every request you make. Authorization headers should be in the
following format:

```
Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN
```

Requests made without authentication will fail with a 401 Unauthorized.

## Requests and responses

Both request body data and response data are formatted as JSON. Responses are
commonly shaped like this:

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "message": "Recipients retrieved",
  "data": { }
}
```

The `meta` key is used for pagination and context when returning lists.

## Errors

The API uses conventional HTTP status codes. Common cases:

- 200 — success
- 400 — validation/client error
- 401 — unauthorized
- 404 — not found
- 5xx — server error

The `message`, `errorCode`, and `errors` fields provide additional details.
