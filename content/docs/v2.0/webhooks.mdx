# Webhooks

Learn how to receive events from Lenco in your application: create a public POST endpoint, verify signatures (X-Lenco-Signature), and respond with 200 OK to acknowledge events. Common events include `transaction.successful`, `bill-payment.successful`, and `pos-transaction`.

Example signature verification (Node/Express):

```js
const crypto = require('crypto')
const webhookHashKey = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(process.env.SECRET_KEY).digest('hex')
const hash = crypto.createHmac('sha512', webhookHashKey).update(JSON.stringify(req.body)).digest('hex')
if (hash === req.headers['x-lenco-signature']) { /* valid */ }
```
