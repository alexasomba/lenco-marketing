# Accept Payments

Lenco provides a simple and convenient payment flow for web with the popup
widget. It can be integrated in a few easy steps.

### Step 1: Collect customer information

You must collect details like email, amount, reference, and optional customer
fields (firstName, lastName, phone) and billing address.

Important parameters include:

| key | Required | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| key | Yes | Your public key from Lenco |
| email | Yes | Customer email |
| reference | Yes | Unique reference — only -, ., _, and alphanumeric allowed |
| amount | Yes | Amount to charge (can include decimals) |
| currency | No | ISO 3-letter currency code |
| channels | No | Array of channels (e.g., [card, mobile-money]) |

### Step 2: Initiate the payment

Include the Lenco inline script and call LencoPay.getPaid with your options.

```html
<script src="https://pay.lenco.co/js/v1/inline.js"></script>
<script>
function getPaidWithLenco() {
  LencoPay.getPaid({
    key: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY',
    reference: 'ref-' + Date.now(),
    email: 'customer@email.com',
    amount: 1000,
    currency: "ZMW",
    channels: ["card", "mobile-money"],
    onSuccess: function (response) {
      const reference = response.reference;
      alert('Payment complete! Reference: ' + reference);
    },
    onClose: function () { alert('Payment was not completed, window closed.'); },
    onConfirmationPending: function () { alert('Pending.'); },
  });
}
</script>
```

Sandbox usage: use https://pay.sandbox.lenco.co/js/v1/inline.js

### Step 3: Handle onSuccess

Verify the payment server-side then acknowledge and complete application flow.

### Step 4: Verify the payment

Call the verify endpoint from your server (example):

```bash
curl https://api.lenco.co/access/v2/collections/status/ref-1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY" \
  -X GET
```

### Step 5: Handle webhooks

Lenco triggers webhook events such as `collection.successful` when payments
complete — configure your webhook URL and verify event signatures.

> Note: Never call the Lenco API directly from the frontend — always perform
> sensitive calls server-side to avoid exposing your secret key.
