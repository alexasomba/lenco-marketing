# Welcome to Lenco's API

With Lenco API, you can access all your accounts and sub-accounts and their transaction histories. You'll learn how to build amazing web and mobile integration payment experiences with the Lenco API.

These docs will cover the available endpoints and provide example code for using the API. They will hopefully help you build your own admin tools or automate processes that previously had to be performed manually.
