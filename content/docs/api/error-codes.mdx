# Error Codes

Lenco's API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of requests.

## HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `200`, `201` | Request was successful and intended action was carried out. Note that we will always send a 200 if a transaction was made. Check the data object to know how the charge went (successful or failed). |
| `400` | A validation or client-side error occurred and the request was not fulfilled. |
| `401` | The request was not authorized. This can be triggered by passing an invalid API key in the authorization header or the lack of one. |
| `404` | Request could not be fulfilled as the requested resource does not exist. |
| `500`, `501`, `502`, `503`, `504` | Request could not be fulfilled due to an error on Lenco's end. This shouldn't happen, so please report as soon as you encounter any instance of this. |

## Error Response Format

If the HTTP response code is not `200` (or `201`), the response would optionally include `errorCode` and/or `errors`.

```json
{
  "status": false,
  "message": "Error description",
  "errorCode": "01",
  "errors": [
    {
      "reference": "ref-12345",
      "errorCode": "04",
      "errorMessage": "Invalid or duplicate reference"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Error Codes Reference

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `01` | Validation error. One or more parameters could not be validated correctly. |
| `02` | Insufficient funds in account |
| `03` | The transfer limit on the account has been exceeded |
| `04` | Invalid or duplicate reference |
| `05` | Invalid recipient account |
| `06` | Restriction on debit account |
| `07` | Invalid or duplicate bulk transfer reference |
| `08` | Invalid number of objects in bulk transfer `transfers` parameter |
| `21` | POS terminal was not found |
| `22` | POS terminal has already been assigned |
| `23` | POS terminal is currently not assigned |
| `24` | POS transaction was not found |

## Handling Errors

### Validation Errors (01)

Check the `errors` array for specific field-level validation issues:

```json
{
  "status": false,
  "message": "Validation error",
  "errorCode": "01",
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": "amount",
      "message": "Amount must be a positive number"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Insufficient Funds (02)

The account doesn't have enough balance for the transaction. Check your account balance before retrying.

### Transfer Limit Exceeded (03)

The transaction exceeds the account's transfer limit. Contact support to increase limits.

### Duplicate Reference (04)

The `reference` you provided has already been used. Each transaction must have a unique reference.

### Invalid Recipient (05)

The recipient account could not be validated. Use the [Resolve](/docs/resolve) endpoint to verify account details first.

<Callout type="info">
**Best Practice**: Always validate account details using the [Resolve](/docs/resolve) endpoint before initiating transfers to avoid errors.
</Callout>
