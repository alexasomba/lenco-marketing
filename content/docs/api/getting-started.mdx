# Getting Started

This page will help you get started with Lenco API.

To get your API token (also referred to as API key or secret key), kindly reach out to [support@lenco.co](mailto:support@lenco.co).

## Securing Your API Token

Someone who steals your Lenco API token can interact with your accounts on your behalf, so treat it as securely as you would treat any password. Tokens should never be stored in source control. If you accidentally publicize a token via version control or other methods, you should immediately reach out to [support@lenco.co](mailto:support@lenco.co) to generate a new API token.

## Using the Token

Authenticate your API calls by including your API token in the Authorization header of every request you make. Authorization headers should be in the following format:

```
Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer xo+CAiijrIy9XvZCYyhjrv0fpSAL6CfU8CgA+up1NXqK" \
  https://api.lenco.co/access/v1/accounts
```

<Callout type="warn">
API requests made without authentication will fail with the status code `401: Unauthorized`. All API requests must be made over HTTPS.
</Callout>

## Requests and Response

Both request body data and response data are formatted as JSON. Content type for responses will always be `application/json`. Generally, all responses will be in the following format:

```json title="Response Format"
{
  "status": true,        // Only true if the request was processed successfully
  "message": "string",   // Explains the result - informational only
  "data": {}             // Contains actionable result of processing
}
```

While we generally recommend that developers use HTTP status codes to determine the result of an API call, we have provided a handy `status` key to let you know upfront if the request was successful or not.

The `message` key is a string which will contain a summary of the response and its status. For instance when trying to retrieve a list of recipients, message might read "Recipients retrieved". In the event of an error, the message key will contain a description of the error.

The `data` key is where you want to look at for the result of your request. It can either be an object, or an array depending on the request made.

## Pagination

For endpoints that return lists, the response includes a `meta` key with pagination parameters:

```json title="Meta Key Structure"
{
  "meta": {
    "total": 2,
    "perPage": 50,
    "currentPage": 1,
    "pageCount": 1
  }
}
```

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `total` | The total number of records |
| `perPage` | The maximum number of records returned per request |
| `currentPage` | The current page being returned (default: 1) |
| `pageCount` | Total pages available based on `perPage` |

## Date-Time Format

All date-time fields are expressed in ISO8601 UTC times.

## Error Handling

Lenco's API is RESTful and uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of requests.

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `200`, `201` | Request was successful |
| `400` | A validation or client-side error occurred |
| `401` | The request was not authorized (invalid or missing API key) |
| `404` | The requested resource does not exist |
| `500`, `501`, `502`, `503`, `504` | Server error - please report these |

For more details on error codes, see the [Error Codes](/docs/error-codes) reference.
