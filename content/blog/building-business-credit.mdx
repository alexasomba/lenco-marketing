## What is Business Credit?

Business credit is separate from your personal credit score. It represents your company's ability to borrow money and repay debts. Building strong business credit opens doors to better financing options.

## Why Business Credit Matters

### Access to Funding

Strong business credit makes it easier to:
- Secure business loans
- Get higher credit limits
- Negotiate better interest rates
- Access trade credit from suppliers

### Protect Personal Assets

When your business has its own credit profile, you can:
- Keep personal and business finances separate
- Protect personal assets from business liabilities
- Build company value independently

### Better Business Terms

Suppliers and vendors check business credit when deciding on payment terms. Good credit can get you:
- Extended payment periods
- Better pricing
- Higher order limits

## Steps to Build Business Credit

### 1. Establish Your Business Properly

Before building credit, ensure your business is properly registered:
- Register with CAC (Corporate Affairs Commission)
- Get your Tax Identification Number (TIN)
- Open a dedicated business bank account

### 2. Separate Business and Personal Finances

Never mix business and personal expenses. Use separate accounts for:
- Business income
- Business expenses
- Payroll
- Tax obligations

### 3. Build Relationships with Vendors

Work with suppliers who report payment history. Start small:
- Pay on time or early
- Gradually request higher credit limits
- Ask for extended payment terms

### 4. Maintain Good Banking Relationships

Your banking behavior matters:
- Keep accounts in good standing
- Avoid overdrafts when possible
- Maintain consistent deposits

### 5. Monitor Your Credit

Regularly check your credit status:
- Request reports from credit bureaus
- Dispute any errors promptly
- Track improvement over time

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Using Personal Credit for Business

This doesn't build business credit and puts personal assets at risk.

### Inconsistent Cash Flow

Irregular deposits and withdrawals can signal instability to lenders.

### Late Payments

Payment history is the biggest factor in credit scores. Always pay on time.

### Not Using Credit

Having credit available but not using it doesn't help build your score. Use credit responsibly and pay it off.
