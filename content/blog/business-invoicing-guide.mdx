## Why Invoicing Matters

Professional invoicing isn't just about requesting payment — it's about establishing credibility, maintaining records, and ensuring smooth cash flow.

## Elements of a Professional Invoice

### Essential Information

Every invoice should include:

1. **Your Business Details**
   - Business name and logo
   - Address and contact information
   - Bank account details
   - Tax identification number

2. **Client Information**
   - Company name
   - Contact person
   - Billing address

3. **Invoice Details**
   - Unique invoice number
   - Invoice date
   - Due date
   - Payment terms

4. **Service/Product Description**
   - Itemized list of goods or services
   - Quantities and rates
   - Subtotal, taxes, and total

## Best Practices for Invoicing

### 1. Invoice Promptly

Send invoices as soon as work is completed or goods are delivered. The sooner you invoice, the sooner you get paid.

### 2. Set Clear Payment Terms

Be specific about when payment is due:
- Net 7 (due in 7 days)
- Net 15 (due in 15 days)
- Net 30 (due in 30 days)

### 3. Make Payment Easy

Provide multiple payment options and clear instructions for each:
- Bank transfer details
- Mobile money options
- Online payment links

### 4. Number Invoices Consistently

Use a consistent numbering system for easy tracking:
- INV-2024-001
- LCO/2024/NOV/001

### 5. Include VAT Where Applicable

If you're VAT registered, clearly show:
- Subtotal
- VAT amount (7.5%)
- Total including VAT

## Handling Late Payments

### Set Up Reminders

- Send a reminder 3 days before due date
- Follow up on the due date
- Send escalating reminders weekly after

### Have a Collections Process

1. Friendly reminder (1-7 days late)
2. Formal notice (8-14 days late)
3. Final notice (15-30 days late)
4. Collections action (30+ days late)

### Prevent Future Issues

- Request deposits for large projects

- Offer early payment discounts
