# Getting started with Lenco — Zambia

Whether you're a small shop or a growing startup in Zambia, Lenco helps you manage funds and collect payments easily.

## 1. Sign up and request your API token

Register on the Lenco dashboard and follow the instructions to obtain your API token. Keep it secret — it's your integration key.

## 2. Base URL and authentication

All requests should be made to `https://api.lenco.co/access/v1` using your token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

## 3. Use virtual accounts for collections

Create virtual accounts for invoices and orders — this helps match incoming payments to their references automatically.

## 4. Accept payments and view transactions

List your accounts and transactions using the `/accounts` and `/transactions` endpoints to build dashboards or reporting.

## 5. Monitor with webhooks

Set up a webhook URL to receive realtime notifications. Remember to verify signatures using the webhook hash key.
