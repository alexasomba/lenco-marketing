# 5 practical tips for small businesses — Zambia

Short, actionable guidance for founders and finance owners in Zambia.

## 1. Keep a cash buffer

Aim for at least 1–2 months of operating expenses to handle fluctuations in demand and supplier delays.

## 2. Use bank and payment channels correctly

Centralize receipts into business accounts and use virtual account numbers to avoid payment reconciliation issues.

## 3. Track compliance and taxes

Stay on top of local tax and statutory requirements — set up alarms to ensure returns and filings are made on time.

## 4. Monitor FX exposure

If you deal with foreign currency, watch rates and hedge major inflows/outflows where possible.

## 5. Automate time‑consuming tasks

Use simple integrations (Lenco API, scheduled jobs) to automate collections, reporting, and reconciliations.
