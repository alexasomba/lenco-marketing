## Understanding Nigerian Business Taxes

Tax compliance is crucial for Nigerian businesses. Understanding your obligations helps you avoid penalties while taking advantage of legitimate tax savings.

## Key Taxes for Nigerian Businesses

### Companies Income Tax (CIT)

For registered companies, CIT is 30% of taxable profits. Small companies (with turnover less than ₦25 million) pay 0%, while medium companies (turnover between ₦25 million and ₦100 million) pay 20%.

### Value Added Tax (VAT)

VAT is currently 7.5% on taxable goods and services. Businesses must register for VAT if their annual turnover exceeds ₦25 million.

### Withholding Tax

Certain payments require withholding tax at source. Rates vary from 5% to 10% depending on the type of payment.

### Pay As You Earn (PAYE)

If you have employees, you must deduct PAYE from their salaries and remit to the tax authority.

## Tax Planning Strategies

### 1. Keep Accurate Records

Good record-keeping is the foundation of tax planning. Document all income and expenses with proper receipts and invoices.

### 2. Claim All Legitimate Deductions

Ensure you're claiming all allowable business expenses:
- Rent and utilities
- Employee salaries and benefits
- Professional fees
- Depreciation on assets
- Interest on business loans

### 3. Time Your Income and Expenses

Strategic timing of income recognition and expense payments can help optimize your tax position across financial years.

### 4. Use Separate Business Accounts

Keep business and personal finances separate. This makes tax preparation easier and ensures you don't miss deductible expenses.
