## Understanding Cash Flow

Cash flow is the lifeblood of any business. It's not just about how much money you make — it's about when that money comes in and goes out. Poor cash flow management is one of the top reasons small businesses fail.

## 1. Invoice Promptly and Follow Up

Don't wait to send invoices. The sooner you invoice, the sooner you get paid.

**Best Practices:**
- Send invoices immediately after delivering goods or services
- Set clear payment terms (Net 15 or Net 30)
- Use automated reminders for overdue payments
- Offer multiple payment options

## 2. Keep Personal and Business Finances Separate

Mixing personal and business funds is a recipe for confusion and potential legal issues.

**Why It Matters:**
- Easier tax preparation
- Clear business performance tracking
- Professional image with clients
- Protection of personal assets

With Lenco, you can open multiple sub-accounts to organize your business finances effectively.

## 3. Build a Cash Reserve

Every business should have an emergency fund. Aim for 3-6 months of operating expenses.

**Tips for Building Reserves:**
- Set aside a percentage of every sale
- Create a dedicated savings sub-account
- Automate transfers to your reserve account
- Review and adjust quarterly

## 4. Monitor Your Cash Flow Weekly

Don't wait for month-end reports. Regular monitoring helps you spot issues early.

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- Cash on hand
- Accounts receivable aging
- Upcoming payments due
- Revenue trends

Lenco's dashboard gives you real-time visibility into all your accounts.

## 5. Negotiate Better Payment Terms

Whether with suppliers or clients, don't be afraid to negotiate.

**With Suppliers:**
- Ask for extended payment terms
- Negotiate early payment discounts
- Consider bulk purchasing discounts

**With Clients:**
- Offer discounts for early payment
- Require deposits for large orders
- Set up payment plans for big invoices

## Take Control of Your Finances

Managing cash flow doesn't have to be complicated. With the right tools and habits, you can keep your business finances healthy and growing.
