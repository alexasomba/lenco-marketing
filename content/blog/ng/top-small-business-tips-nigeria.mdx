# 5 Quick tips to run a healthier small business — Nigeria

These practical tips are tailored to Nigerian small businesses and startups.

## 1. Keep your accounting tidy

Use simple bookkeeping practices — reconcile your receipts with Lenco transactions regularly.

## 2. Separate personal and business finances

Open a dedicated business account and move all business-related inflows and outflows through it.

## 3. Budget for taxes and levies

Nigeria has different taxes depending on your business size. Set aside at least 20% of profits to handle tax, VAT, and statutory charges.

## 4. Use virtual accounts for collections

Create virtual accounts for invoices to automatically match payments and reduce manual reconciliation time.

## 5. Automate common tasks

Use Lenco API endpoints and scheduled jobs to automate payouts, reconciliations, and reporting.
