# Getting started with Lenco — Nigeria

Lenco is built for businesses in Nigeria — from sole traders and startups to small and medium enterprises. This short guide explains the quickest way to start accepting payments and managing your business finances with Lenco.

## 1. Create your account

Register on the Lenco dashboard and request an API token from the integrations section. Keep this token safe — treat it like a password.

## 2. Configure your API token

All requests are made to `https://api.lenco.co/access/v1` and must include your token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

## 3. Add a bank account

Create or link a business bank account on your Lenco dashboard. Use the `/accounts` endpoints to list and manage accounts programmatically.

## 4. Start sending and receiving payments

- Use `/virtual-accounts` to create collection accounts for invoices and orders.
- Use `/transfer` to send money to recipients and `/transactions` to fetch histories.

## 5. Integrate webhooks

Set up a webhook URL and verify the signature using the HMAC SHA512 algorithm and your `webhook_hash_key` to receive real-time notifications.

## 6. Need help?
